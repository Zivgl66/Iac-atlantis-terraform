# Infrastructure GitOps Project

## Overview

This repository contains the Terraform code and configuration for deploying and managing infrastructure using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The project uses Atlantis for GitOps automation and integrates with GitLab CI/CD for continuous integration and deployment.

## How to Use the Terraform Repo with Atlantis

### Prerequisites

- **Clone the Repository**:

  - Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

### Setting Up Atlantis

**_set up in your vm instance_**

1. **Enter Credentials into HashiCorp Vault**:

   - Store your Gitlab credentials and other sensitive information in HashiCorp Vault. For example:

     ```sh
     vault kv put secret/atlantis gh_user=your-github-username gh_token=your-github-token
     ```

2. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**:

   - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

3. **Run the Setup Script**:

   - The setup script `start_atlantis.sh` is provided in the repository. This script will fetch the secrets from HashiCorp Vault and start Atlantis in a container.

     ```sh
     ./start_atlantis.sh
     ```

### Workflow with Atlantis and GitLab CI/CD

1. **Feature Branch Development**:

   - Create a new branch for your feature or change.
   - Make your infrastructure changes in this branch.

     ```sh
     git checkout -b feature-branch
     ```

2. **Push Changes to GitLab**:

   - Push your feature branch to GitLab.

     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Describe your changes"
     git push origin feature-branch
     ```

3. **Create a Merge Request**:

   - Create a merge request from your feature branch to the `main` branch in GitLab.
   - Atlantis will automatically detect the merge request and add a comment with the Terraform plan.

4. **Review the Plan**:

   - Review the plan generated by Atlantis in the merge request comments.

5. **Approve the Merge Request**:

   - Approve the merge request to allow Atlantis to proceed with applying the changes.

6. **Apply the Changes**:

   - Comment `atlantis apply` on the merge request to instruct Atlantis to apply the changes.

     ```plaintext
     atlantis apply
     ```

7. **Atlantis Applies the Changes**:

   - Atlantis will apply the changes using `terraform apply`, running the GitLab CI pipeline if configured, and then comment when it's done.

8. **Auto-Merge the Changes**:
   - After successfully applying the changes, Atlantis will automatically merge the feature branch into the `main` branch.

## GitOps Workflow

### Atlantis and GitLab CI/CD Integration

- **Atlantis**:

  - Atlantis is a tool that facilitates GitOps for Terraform, enabling teams to automate Terraform workflows based on Git events.
  - Automates Terraform workflows by creating plans and applying changes based on GitLab merge requests.
  - Configured to wait for approval before applying changes and automatically merge changes after successful application.

- **GitLab CI/CD**:
  - Used for continuous integration and deployment, running tests, and ensuring code quality before merging.

### How Atlantis works

- **Webhook Configuration**:

  - Webhook Setup: A webhook is set up in your GitLab repository to notify Atlantis of events such as merge request creation, updates, and comments.
  - Event Handling: When a webhook event occurs (e.g., a merge request is created), GitLab sends an HTTP POST request to the Atlantis server.

- **Event Processing**:

  - Event Detection: Atlantis detects the event and extracts necessary information such as the repository URL, branch name, and commit SHA.
  - Repository Cloning: Atlantis clones the repository to its local workspace using the provided Git credentials.

- **Plan Creation**:

  - Terraform Plan: Atlantis runs terraform plan to create an execution plan that shows what changes will be made to the infrastructure.
  - Plan Output: The output of the plan is posted as a comment on the merge request for team members to review.

### Workflow Steps

1. **Feature Branch Development**:

   - Developers create feature branches for new changes.

2. **Merge Request Creation**:

   - Merge requests are created to merge feature branches into the main branch.
   - Atlantis triggers a Terraform plan to preview infrastructure changes.

3. **Review and Approval**:
   - Merge requests are reviewed and approved by team members.
   - Upon approval, a team member comments atlantis apply to apply the changes.
   - Atlantis applies the changes and merges the pull request.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### Challenge: Managing Environment Variables

- **Solution**: Used environment variables and secret management tools (Hashicorp Vault) to securely manage sensitive information.

### Challenge: Ensuring Network Security

- **Solution**: Implemented VPC, subnets, and restrictive firewall rules to isolate resources and limit access.

### Challenge: Planning the Topology of the Cloud VPC and Using a Private Subnet to Secure the Instance and App

- **Solution**: Designed a VPC with both public and private subnets. Instances hosting the application are placed in a private subnet to ensure they are not directly exposed to the internet. A NAT gateway is used for outbound internet access from the private subnet, ensuring security and control over traffic.

### Challenge: Using the Application Load Balancer to Provide Access

- **Solution**: Implemented an HTTP load balancer to distribute traffic across instances. The load balancer forwards requests to instances in the private subnet. This setup ensures that the application is accessible while keeping the backend instances secure.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of Terraform and GitOps practices to manage infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform. By integrating Atlantis and GitLab CI/CD, we ensure a robust and automated workflow for infrastructure changes. Monitoring and logging are set up to provide insights and alerts on the infrastructure's health and performance.
